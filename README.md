# AndWait Matcher #

Small hamcrest matcher which is waiting (with timeout) for the expected value 

### how it works
```java
    assertThat(this::receiveMessage, andWait(is(equalTo("Howdy"))));
```
* this matcher works with the default hamcrest "assertThat"
* first parameter receives a function that will be called until the expected value is present (Success) or timeout (Exception) is received
* you can define a custom timeout by using the second optional parameter of the "andWait" matcher 
```java
    assertThat(this::receiveMessage, andWait(is(equalTo("Howdy")), 500));
```

#### Matcher assertionError example
```text
    Expected:
         but: [Timeout]
    Expected: is "unknown message"
         but: was "other message"
```

### known issues
* AssertionError is having two descriptions, first is timeout and second is mismatch
